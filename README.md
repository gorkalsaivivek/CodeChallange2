# Palindrome Detection
Write a function that determines if a given string is a palindrome. A
palindrome is a word or phrase that is spelled exactly the same forwards
or backwards, like "pop" or "Ah, Satan sees Natasha". For this question,
ignore all non-alphanumeric characters and assume that upper-and lowercase
characters are identical. The function should output whether or not
the string is a palindrome and return a boolean.
